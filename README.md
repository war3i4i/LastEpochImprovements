## LootFilter Item Map Show to "Last Epoch" game

### Mod allows your item from LootFilter to also be shown on map (as unique or set items do). Works in both offline and online
#### Mod on [NEXUSMODS]

How to use:
Any rule that has "Emphasized" turned on will automatically be shown on map

How to install:

1) Download [MelonLoader.Installer.exe] & Install MelonLoader. Im using v6.1 since v6.2 has a small bug that sometimes doesn't start your game
   .
   (HOW-TO [melonwiki])
- Run [MelonLoader.Installer.exe].
    - Click the SELECT button.
    - Select and Open the Game's EXE in your Game's Installation Folder.
    - Select which Version of MelonLoader to install using the Drop-Down List. (Or leave it as-is for the Latest Version.)
    - Click the INSTALL or RE-INSTALL button.
2) Put into Last Epoch folder
3) Start game and wait till it generates .dll files
4) Turn off the game
5) Put my mod inside Mods folder
6) Start game

I am using my own mod in Online and everything is fine. But keep in mind that modifying game client is against Last Epoch ToS so using it outside offline mod is at your own risk
